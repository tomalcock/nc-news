<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is my first every full-stack application. It has a mobile first UX design and allows uses to scroll through news articles. A user may wish to:

* View all articles
* View topics available 
* Search for topics (although there are currently only 3 available in the production database at the moment)
* Log in as a user already in the database (no authentication feature currently). This then displays on all screens
* Sign out as the user
* Vote on an article (which sends a patch request to the API)
* Post a comment (which sends a post request to the API)
* Delete a comment (which sends a delete request to the API)


Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
